# Crypto-Harden-GPO
A series of powershell-command scripts that create GPO's that help with hardening the crypto settings on target Windows systems within an AD domain

Based the commands off the hardening script available from https://www.hass.de/content/setup-microsoft-windows-or-iis-ssl-perfect-forward-secrecy-and-tls-12

That script seems intended for use on single/individual servers - wanted to see if I could base the same changes for use into a GPO that could be applied to a mass of systems within an Active Directory domain.
